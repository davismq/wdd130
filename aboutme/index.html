    <h2>Davis Quist</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Davis. I'm from Utah and I used to go to BYU-Provo before deciding to do online classes instead. I love technology stuff like my computer that I built. I currently work for a homebuilder as an architectural draftsman and my goal is to someday own my own home design business. I have always liked design and architecture and it felt like a natural fit to study construction management at BYU followed by a masters degree in architecture, but I soon realized that it wasn't my favorite thing. I got married to my amazing wife in October 2021, so just a little over 6 months ago.</p>
    <p>I have always had an interest in coding and computer science but I have never had a good opportunity to get into it, much less a good reason to. I have looked into the benefits of knowing code in the architecture and design profession and I have figured that knowing at least a little bit of coding will help me in the long run. I am excited to learn the basics of web design and I am excited to see how this will help further me in my career. I am always open to different opportunities around me and if the opportunity presents itself to change career and go into the coding and web design industry I would be up to it.</p>
