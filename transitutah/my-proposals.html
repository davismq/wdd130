        <p>Now, I must say, I am no expert on these topics. I love reading about new and exciting developments and ideas that are being thrown into the public square. I think about these things because they interest me, and I have also gotten very annoyed with the state of things right now. I have a lot of time to reflect about what I would change and why I would change it while I sit in my parked car on the freeway during rush hour or wait for my late train. Concerned with many of the previously stated problems, I have thought of a few things that, perhaps, many people have not considered on top of the previously propositioned fixes. One of the main things that has constricted infrastructure growth in Utah Valley is Utah Lake. I think that there is sufficient growth on the west side of the lake to warrant serious discussion and planning of a dike that crosses the lake to aid commuters and give them more options to travel, as well as being a unique opportunity for public projects.</p>

        <p>I would propose, if given the chance, that there be a dike created connecting the east and west sides of the lake. This dike would only be for a light rail with room enough for a service road. In the middle of the dike would be large island public park that is only accessible by light rail or by boat at the various docks and would close every night. This would help kickstart more development on both sides of the lake and would be great planning for future development. Another one of my thought's centers on the UVX (Utah Valley Express) bus used in Orem and Provo. It is a free-to-use bus with 10-12 stations that runs between the Orem and Provo Frontrunner stations. From personal experience, it has overwhelmingly positive reviews and is used all day long. This is the only location in the state that has implemented the use of rapid bus transit. The busses are nicer than normal transit busses and faster than normal bus routes. It is of my view that if there were UVX-esque busses connecting a few stations all along the current route of the Frontrunner, incentivizing and simplifying public transit, then congestion on the freeway, as well as commuting times in general, would decrease.</p>
