      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Is there anything worse than sitting in traffic all afternoon waiting to get home? Have you ever wished there was an easier way? That is where I come in… I spread awareness about the FrontRunner commuter trains here in Utah and how they can help you enjoy your ride to work more than ever. I make it as easy as possible for people to understand how the trains work and when the trains run as well as what the future holds for your commute along the Wasatch Front and beyond.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I am trying to reach people who first and foremost live in Utah, but the reality is that the concepts and ideas that I intend to illustrate on this website can and should be applied in a multitude of different places. Second, I want people who are interested in the future of public rail transit as well as people who are tired of traffic to discover and interact with the website.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h4>Current State of the Commute</h4>
      <p>
        The current state of the commute for the average Utah or Salt Lake Valley commuter is not great. Occasionally, you will have a nice drive home on the freeway and there won’t be any traffic at all, but once you wake up from that dream you will find that it is rarely, if ever, even close to that. Every single day, there is congestion, slow-downs, and traffic on your commute to and from work. If you happen to think, “Oh, hm, maybe I should take the Frontrunner commuter train to work instead of driving to avoid the traffic,” there is a good chance that you will be stuck waiting at the station because of a delay and you might not even get a seat on the train when it arrives because of overcrowding. I find that this is all unacceptable, seeing as that there were many years of construction all along the Wasatch front with the goal of widening the freeway, creating new lanes and exits, and decongesting the roads. The Frontrunner commuter train was created not too many years ago to take people off the road and provide a safer, calmer, relaxing, and more environmentally friendly way to commute to work. In my opinion, both projects did nothing more than postpone the traffic and commuting problem. I believe that although both commuting styles have their respective pros and cons the future of the commute along the Wasatch front is by rail and other forms of public transit.

      <h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        There are only few solutions that have been proposed to address these issues. The first is to improve the Frontrunner commuter train. What is currently in place was only ever meant to get the so-called “foot-in-the-door” with commuters, a test-run to see if people would use the train, how many people would use it, to get feedback from the public about possible improvements, and to start getting long term infrastructure in place. For a few years now, there have been commissions created and studies completed to assess the future expansion of the train. A few of the popular solutions include double tracking the entire length of track, if not only the more bottlenecked areas; increasing the frequency and capacity of trains; vanpooling from the Frontrunner stations directly to work locations; adding new stations along the current track as well as extending both north and south from the current track to attract a larger amount of people; and to increase the connections between Frontrunner stations and other forms of public transportation. There are a lot of ways to go about improving things as they stand right now, but although I think that many of these ideas are great, I don’t think that these ideas go far enough.

      <h3>Ideal Personal Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        Now, I must say, I am no expert on these topics. I love reading about new and exciting developments and ideas that are being thrown into the public square. I think about these things because they interest me, and I have also gotten very annoyed with the state of things right now. I have a lot of time to reflect about what I would change and why I would change it while I sit in my parked car on the freeway during rush hour or wait for my late train. Concerned with many of the previously stated problems, I have thought of a few things that, perhaps, many people have not considered on top of the previously propositioned fixes. One of the main things that has constricted infrastructure growth in Utah Valley is Utah Lake. I think that there is sufficient growth on the west side of the lake to warrant serious discussion and planning of a dike that crosses the lake to aid commuters and give them more options to travel, as well as being a unique opportunity for public projects. I would propose, if given the chance, that there be a dike created connecting the east and west sides of the lake. This dike would only be for a light rail with room enough for a service road. In the middle of the dike would be large island public park that is only accessible by light rail or by boat at the various docks and would close every night. This would help kickstart more development on both sides of the lake and would be great planning for future development. Another one of my thought’s centers on the UVX (Utah Valley Express) bus used in Orem
